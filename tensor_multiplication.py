def create_tensor_of_val(dimensions, val):
    """
    Create a tensor of the given dimensions, filled with the value of `val`.
    dimentions is a tuple of integers.
    Hint: use torch.ones and multiply by val, or use torch.zeros and add val.
    e.g. if dimensions = (2, 3), and val = 3, then the returned tensor should be of shape (2, 3)
    specifically, it should be:
    tensor([[3., 3., 3.], [3., 3., 3.]])

    e.g: if X is a tensor of shape (1,3) then W could be a tensor of shape (N,3) i.e: (1,3) or (2,3) etc. but in order for 
         matmul to work, we need to multiply by W.T (W transpose) so that the `inner` dimensions are the same.
    Hint: use torch.matmul to calculate the product.
          This allows us to use a batch of inputs, and not just a single input.
          Also, it allows us to use the same function for a single neuron or multiple neurons.
